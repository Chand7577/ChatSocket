# ChatSocket
ChatSocket is an example that shows how programs can talk to each other over the internet, a local network, or even on the same computer. With socket programming, developers can make applications where one program acts like a host, waiting for others to connect (the server), and other programs reach out to connect to it (the client).
# To run the Socket  Program
Open a terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the socket program is located.

# Run the Script
Execute the Python script by running the following command in your terminal or command prompt:
                  python3 or python tserver.py
                  python3 or python tclient.py
